# Virtual Hosts
#
# Required modules: mod_log_config

# If you want to maintain multiple domains/hostnames on your
# machine you can setup VirtualHost containers for them. Most configurations
# use only name-based virtual hosts so the server doesn't need to worry about
# IP addresses. This is indicated by the asterisks in the directives below.
#
# Please see the documentation at
# <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/vhosts/>
# for further details before you try to setup virtual hosts.
#
# You may use the command line option '-S' to verify your virtual host
# configuration.

#
# VirtualHost example:
# Almost any Apache directive may go into a VirtualHost container.
# The first VirtualHost section is used for all requests that do not
# match a ServerName or ServerAlias in any <VirtualHost> block.
#

<Directory "/Path/to/Dev/Localhost">
  Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymlinks
  AllowOverride All
  Order allow,deny
  Allow from all
</Directory>

<Virtualhost *:80>
  VirtualDocumentRoot "/Path/to/Dev/Localhost"
  ServerName home.dev
  UseCanonicalName Off
</Virtualhost>

#
# For any directory in the Dev environment, set up a vhost at dir-name.dev
#
<Virtualhost *:80>
  VirtualDocumentRoot "/Path/to/Dev/%1"
  ServerName sites.dev
  ServerAlias *.dev
  UseCanonicalName Off
</Virtualhost>

#
# Now make those same directories available through the xip service for device testing
#
<Virtualhost *:80>
  VirtualDocumentRoot "/Path/to/Dev/%-7+"
  ServerName xip
  ServerAlias *.xip.io
  UseCanonicalName Off
</Virtualhost>

#
# For any projects where the webroot isn't the directory you'll need to make a separate vhost
# block for it. (example: Drupal 8 project where the web root is dir-name/web)
